# Large photoviewer
 Large photo viewer ( made for aerial photography)

 I use vips to create the images. Then I put them into the `tiles` folder.
 Then add the details to the `script.js` file.

 ## Usage
    1. Install vips
    2. Install the dependencies
    3. Run the script
    4. Open the launch.bat file
    5. On a web browser, open `http://localhost:8000`
